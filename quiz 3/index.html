			<h1>CREAM</h1>
		</header>
		Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, will eventually rise to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called "separators".Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-butterfat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization.
