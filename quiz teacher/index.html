		The new products will includes three new flavours, including premium vanilla, pear caramel and lemon biscuit in addition to the current strawberry flavour.Despite having been in the market for over 90 years, Delamere majorly produced the strawberry flavour, which earned it 67% market share in the yoghurt market, according to its Marketing Director Oliver Mary. “This is a major milestone for the Delamere brand which has a rich heritage,” he said. </p>
